# Petaldust

This is the project data for Petaldust, a touhou fan game made in 72 hours for a game jam. This project contains elements of creative expression that constitute a fanwork of the Touhou Project, created by Team Shanghai Alice. This project is not officially recognized by Team Shanghai Alice, and is created and shared in accordance with the official Touhou Project fanworks guidelines.

The version of petaldust in this repository differs slightly from the game jam version. A small number of bugs have been fixed, and functionality has been added to make speedrunning easier.

This project contains at least one godot addon. Such addons are not considered part of this project's code and are subject to their own licenses.

This project contains sound effects under the "sounds" directory. I'm *pretty* sure I managed to delete everything that I didn't make by myself. These sound effects can be used freely as long as you do not re-sell them as sound effects. Selling works created with them as a minor part (e.g. games, music) is fine.

This project contains graphical assets under several directories. I do not own all of these and am not at liberty to redistribute some of them as assets (they are only provided here to retain the integrity of the project data); do not use the copies here in other projects, get them from the original creators instead. See resources.txt for more details. The graphical assets that were created by me are shared here informally under good faith.

This project contains music that derives from Touhou Project compositions. This music cannot be sold, and is shared here informally under good faith.

The project contains the font "Yuusei Magic", licensed under the OFL. Its license is included next to its font file.

All elements of this project which derive in creative expression from the Touhou Project are subject to the Touhou Project fanworks guidelines.
