All of these images are taken from autotyler (https://github.com/wareya/autotyler) aside from blobby which is (badly) modified from the red tileset to help showcase the scanline algorithm better.

I didn't feel like making my own example tilesets at the moment, i'll eventually replace them with more sizes/variants to showcase more features.
